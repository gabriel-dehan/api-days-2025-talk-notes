**Based on insights from Axelle Arquié**

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the nature of work. While previous waves of automation targeted physical force (the steam engine) or repetitive administrative tasks (early computing), the current wave targets **cognition** itself.

For a long time, economists relied on "Polanyi's Paradox"—the idea that "we know more than we can tell," meaning we couldn't automate tasks requiring intuition or implicit knowledge. That paradox is no longer true. With the rise of Generative AI, machines have gained semantic understanding and the ability to manage uncertainty. We are building a **cognitive infrastructure**.

### The Bubble and The Infrastructure
Is AI a bubble? Likely, yes. We see classic warning signs: over-projection, reliance on debt, and Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) financing data centers with no current revenue.

However, bubbles are often revolutionary. Consider the **Railway Mania of 1845**. It was a massive financial crash, but the infrastructure built during that mania remained. Even after the bubble burst, the rails were there to change the world. We are currently over-investing in infrastructure that will eventually become cheap and ubiquitous.

### The Productivity Lag (The Electricity Lesson)
If AI makes us so efficient, why don't we see the productivity gains in the GDP yet?

Productivity takes time. When electricity was invented in 1870, it took **40 years** (until 1910) for productivity figures to spike. It wasn't enough to just replace steam engines with electric motors; factory owners had to completely redesign the floor plan and workflows to utilize the new power source.

We are currently at the "invention stage" with GenAI. We face an organizational bottleneck. We haven't yet figured out the new roles or how to redesign the "cognitive assembly line" to keep humans effectively in the loop.

### The Risk: Cognitive Taylorism
As we transition from legacy deterministic systems (code that does exactly what it's told) to probabilistic systems (AI that guesses and creates), the power dynamic shifts.

There is a significant risk of **"Cognitive Taylorism."** Just as Taylorism stripped autonomy from factory workers to maximize efficiency, AI could strip autonomy from knowledge workers, reducing their work to feeding the machine while subjecting them to algorithmic surveillance.

### The White Collar Shift
Historically, automation creates winners and losers. During the Industrial Revolution, it took 70 years of pain for segments of the population like cotton-weavers before the new economy created enough new accessible jobs. More recently, robotics and word processing hollowed out routine clerical work, creating the wage gap we see today.

Now, we face a potential "white collar bloodbath." AI ability to handle complexity is doubling every 7 months. We are already seeing:
*   **Devaluation of degrees:** The premium on standard college education is dropping.
*   **Junior hiring freeze:** As AI handles entry-level cognitive tasks, juniors are being hired less, breaking the traditional mentorship pipeline.

### The Macro Dilemma
If AI makes a worker 8 times more productive, one of two things must happen:
1.  **Demand increases 8x:** We consume vastly more services, keeping everyone employed (The Optimistic View).
2.  **Job reduction:** We don't need as many people, leading to mass disruption (The Realistic Fear).

In either case, the transition is socially costly. Even if the number of jobs were retained and were to simply change and evolve, retraining takes time and money.

### Conclusion: The Need for an Equity Pool
We are heading toward a shock that will redefine the balance of power between Capital and Labor. If we want to prevent a "winner takes all" dynamic where only the owners of the AI infrastructure profit, we need radical redistribution strategies.

Apart from UBI, one proposal is of an **Equity Pool**, where perhaps 10% of the capital of AI companies is set aside for redistribution. Without systemic intervention, the inequality gap will likely widen beyond recovery. The infrastructure is being built; the question is who will own the benefits.
