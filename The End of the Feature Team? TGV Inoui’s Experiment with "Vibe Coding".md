**A case study in AI-driven agility**

For the past year, TGV Inoui R&D team has been quietly running an experiment that challenges the standard structure of modern software development. The traditional "Feature Team"—usually a squad of about 8 people—has been dismantled.

In its place? A micro-team of just 2 to 3 people, one product owner and one "AI Tech lead" managing AI agents.

### The Death of the Slide Deck
The most immediate cultural shift in this new workflow is the disappearance of the presentation deck. TGV Inoui has stopped using Keynote to pitch ideas to top management.

In this new "Vibe Coding" era, you don't pitch a concept; you ship a prototype. Because the barrier to entry for coding has dropped so drastically, even designers are now "vibe coding"—using AI tools to generate functional interfaces without needing deep knowledge of syntax. The workflow has shifted from abstract discussions to tangible demonstrations.

### The New Workflow: Front-Loading Human Intelligence
This isn't about AI taking over the creative process. The team notes that the workflow still requires significant human effort at the very beginning. The "specs" and the vision require human intuition and definition.

However, once the specifications are locked in, the execution is offloaded to AI. The heavy lifting of writing the code is automated, allowing the small team to move at a pace impossible for a standard 8-person squad.

### Case Study: Apple Vision Pro
The most concrete example of this success is TGV Inoui’s experience on the Apple Vision Pro.

The initial product was developed the "traditional" way: built by professional developers with a focus on a clean, scalable codebase. However, the *maintenance* and evolution of that product have been handed over to a "Vibe Coding" duo: one designer and one developer.

They have successfully maintained the application without a full engineering team, transitioning from long development cycles to rapid updates.

### The Strategic Shift
This approach represents a massive shift in power and logistics:
*   **Internalization:** The company is moving away from reliance on external vendors.
*   **Speed:** Long development cycles are being replaced by rapid, product-led updates.
*   **Autonomy:** By empowering designers to code and developers to move faster, the gap between "idea" and "product" has effectively vanished.
